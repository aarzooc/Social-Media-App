# HospiCHAT APP

Healthcare Systems R&A app to promote communication between patients in hospitals. Patients experiencing long-term hospital visits can face loneliness, social isolation and depression. This can be attributed to the lack of communication tools available for these specific individuals within a hospital setting. This repository is being used to develop an app tailored to long-term hospital patients to allow them to connect with other individuals experiencing similar circumstances. This in-hospital social media app will offer different modes of communication such as direct messaging, group messaging, and video and audio calling. Users will also be able to post anonymous or known status updates on social boards. We aim to meet the accessibility needs of a wide range of patients. Ultimately, the goal of the app is to foster a safe space for individuals to create lasting relationships and decrease the anxiety and depression associated with long-term hospital stays.
